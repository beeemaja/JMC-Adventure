This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.


To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

The player has many options in the game: one can walk around rooms, take and drop items, 
eat some eatable items.

The goal of the player is to defeat the dragon in the Boss room and find the Holy Grail.
